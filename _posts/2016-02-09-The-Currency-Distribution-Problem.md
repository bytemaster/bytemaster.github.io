The distribution of currency is extremely controversial and ultimately a political issue. Whenever new currency is created it transfers value from the previous holders of the currency to someone new. A similar economic outcome could be achieved by a savings tax that reduces everyone's balance and gives it to someone else. If markets were perfectly efficient then the purchasing power of someone's account would be the same whether the inflationary approach or the tax and transfer approach is used.


When a currency is as universally accepted as the United States dollar people are left with little recourse except to complain while their purchasing power is slowly eroded. The ability to control where new money is directed gives the government and the central bank almost unlimited economic power. [Even the most benevolent dictator backed by the most efficient bureaucracy would be unable to efficiently allocate even a small amount of inflation](https://mises.org/library/economic-calculation-socialist-commonwealth).
