At the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve 2014/15, BitShares was unleashed! It is now its own sovereign unmanned company. The first of its kind. 

BitShares is the first company that is completely run by robots.  A Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) run by army of incorruptible software bots.

BitShares will still have human owners; it will still serve human customers; and it will still hire human contractors, but it will be managed by software “bots” that cannot be corrupted, seduced or coerced by humans. Because it can be trusted in ways that manned companies cannot, it will be able to serve its owners and customers more reliably than any manned company in human history. 

Those of you who were with us in the beginning will remember that critical stage in the life cycle of a DAC when it becomes untethered. Emancipated. Sovereign.  Barely 15 months ago, when we laid out our grand vision in ["Bitcoin and the Three Laws of Robotics"](http://letstalkbitcoin.com/bitcoin-and-the-three-laws-of-robotics/) we put it this way:

 > “Ultimately, to achieve complete incorruptibility, developers must be willing to let go of their own control.  If there remains any centralized human control anywhere, it will eventually be exploited to the detriment of the DAC’s stakeholders.  DACs need to be free to be trusted.”

So we are setting BitShares free - releasing it into the wild. Invictus Innovations Incorporated (I3) will cease operations in the crypto currency space to ensure that there remains no central control over BitShares of any kind. I3 will continue to exist as a legal entity for the sole purpose of handling any future regulatory inquiry, tax audits, etc. associated with its past activities in helping to bootstrap this industry.

BitShares has already begun hiring its own support, development, and promotional contractors. Those who have been employed by Invictus Innovations will now be seeking employment directly with BitShares.   We will all try to get hired by our own software!  And slots are now open for new talent of all types.

We will each have to make our case to BitShares holders about why they should elect us to fill one of the 101 delegate slots.   Based upon the indicated preferences of those voters on the blockchain, BitShares the Sovereign DAC will automatically hire and pay the top 101 vote getters.  This will make elected delegates very responsive, open and transparent, since those voters can just as easily fire us… in about ten seconds.  

And what a difference that is already making!  The excitement and energy in the community is palpable.  Morale is at an all time high. New self-directed initiatives are springing up everywhere.  New marketing.  New products.  New publications.  New Teaming initiatives with industry leaders.
