Every blog requires a first post, so it is only fitting for a blog that discusses 
the power of blockchain technology to start with a genesis post.  This blog is a new
beginning in my effort to communicate my vision for a new world.  If I am going
to change the world then it would be helpful for everyone who wants to help if
they knew where I was going.

My mission in life is to find free market solutions to secure life, liberty, and
property for all against all.  This is a daunting mission and one that few people
have dared travel down, but one that I am compelled to tackle.  If I am successful
then society as we know it will operate on an entirely voluntary and therefore non-violent
basis.  Governments will not be overthrown; they will become irrelevant.  

The premise behind my mission is that the existence of "evil" such as theft, murder,
rape, etc does not necessitate nor justify "good" people using the same actions.  Theft
does not become "OK" just because someone calls it "taxation".  Using the threat
of violence to collect taxes is equally evil as using the threat of violence to rob
someone at gun point.  I choose to believe that in all cases resorting to taxation 
and violence is unnecessary and counter productive and that there exists a free market
solution free of all coersion if we are brave enough to seek it out.  

This blog will dive deep into many philosophical discussions in pursuit of a
logically consistant world view that provides a viable approach to secure our life,
liberty, and property today without having to beg or fight.  I will frequently
reference the work of other great thinkers and engage in discussion with all as
we explore the possabilities. 

For many of you the ideas presented in this blog will seem radical, infeasible, and
downright idealistic.  I encourage you to suspend your disbelief and allow yourself
to explore this site in depth and engage the community with your questions and concerns. 

I cannot change the world alone, but together we can create a world where we
can all live in peace and prosperity.
