iii. attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on BitShares's web site;
iv. remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or
v. transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.

b. This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by BitShares at any time.
