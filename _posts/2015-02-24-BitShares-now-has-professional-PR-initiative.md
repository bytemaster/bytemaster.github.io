Bitshares has come a long way since its debut. We have many achievements on the development front in the past few months, and our market cap had reached several milestones during that time. Despite the current setback, we still strongly believe that we will prevail over all the challenges that we would face moving forward, because we have a solid technology, an amazing development team and the support from a community that has been enduring the challenges with us every step of the way. For that, we’re forever grateful.
 
## The issues that we’re facing

In every journey, we would learn more about our strength and weakness along the way. We should embrace our strength and recognize our weakness. Either we evolve faster than the others to further the cause and avoid mistakes, or we would be defeated by those who could. It’s as simple as that. 
 
Bitshares platform and market pegged assets like BitUSD are our greatest achievement so far, it’s working. And it could have the potential to change the world as we know.  The accuracy of the peg matters, but the issue with low market depth and low liquidity have been hindering the progress of mass adoption. If we can’t improve the situation, it would be hard to convince big businesses and merchants to adopt BitAssets. Without the mass adoption of BitAssets, Bitshares can not go any further in the long run. 
 
## We need better PR to further our cause

Market depth and liquidity are two indicators of investors’ confidence. Without securing investors’ confidence in a large scale, everything that we’re trying to build would be based purely on a dream. After reviewing our past, we’ve come to the conclusion that we need better PR management to further our cause. Because apparently while we kept ignoring the need for perfect PR due to our limitations and our idealism, every major competitor in the Crypto 2.0 space are taking advantage of our mistakes, they have professional PR teams literally armed to their teeth and gaining more attention even from our long term supporters; they’re gaining more serious long term investors for their advantage in PR. We will have to be adapted to the situation, no matter how hard that changes could be. We must survive first and thrive on the trail of mistakes that we left behind, and move on from there.  
 
The developers (namely Core Developers) are in a unique place in the eco-system at this early stage. This fact has made them impossible to propose any changes or make any remarks without affecting the market and investors’ confidence at some point. We need to do better than that, seeing how that has cost us deeply. 
 
## Our solution for PR issues

After careful consideration, the Core Developers would like to appoint DACx, a cornerstone business of the Bitshares ecosystem founded by Mr. James Gong (aka. Baozou) that could bring us to a place where we could only have dreamed of, as the official spokesman (the “Spokesman”) on behalf of the Core Developers to take over the PR initiative.  Bytemaster and the other Core Developers will accordingly be cooperating with this PR initiative moving forward and defer to the Spokesman in any PR matters.  Bytemaster believes that such a team with impressive PR management skills will significantly enhance both the intra-community communications and the investors’ confidence on the prospect of Bitshares, thus bringing us a greater step forward. 
 
Rest assured, the Core Developers, as led by Bytemaster, will be working closely with the Spokesman on information disclosure, in a different manner from what the community members experienced, in order to prevent any further PR mistakes that could easily ruin the achievements that we work so hard for. Things have to change from now on because this exciting and difficult journey has taught us that we shouldn’t do whatever makes us comfortable, and that we should do whatever it takes to make us stronger and undefeatable. 
 
The general principle of this PR appointment is to empower the Spokesman to exclusively represent the Core Developers in terms of publicity and to be the only outlet in terms of information disclosure.  In this connection, the Spokesman will be publishing detailed PR guidelines from time to time for the parties involved to follow.  Below sets out some of them and more will come:  
 
1. The Core Developers (including any member thereof individually) should neither propose any drastic changes to Bitshares nor speak of their ideas thereof on the forum until extensive research has been done properly, a firm resolution among the Core Developers has been made and the Spokesman grants clearance to the release of that proposal. 
 
2. The Core Developers (including any member thereof individually) should make no comment on any subject on the forum unless approved by and posted through the Spokesman.  Bug reports and their discussion should take place on github.
 
3. The Core Developers (including any member thereof individually) should not disclose sensitive information of potential partnerships, collaborations or arrangement with any other organization unless approved by and communicated through the Spokesman.
 
4. The Core Developers (including any member thereof individually) should not air their internal discussions or debates on any open issue until all the underlying facts are ascertained, a well-founded conclusion has been drawn, and the Spokesman grants clearance to that disclosure. 
 
5. The Core Developers (including any member thereof individually) should never comment on any other crypto-currency or project on the forum unless approved by and posted through the Spokesman. 
 
6. The Core Developers (including any member thereof individually) should not answer any question regarding Bitshares’ development or prospect or heed any request to predict anything about Bitshares or give forward-looking comments unless the relevant questions or requests are directed by the Spokesman to the Core Developers and the answers of the Core Developers are approved by and communicated through the Spokesman.
 
7. Always keep in mind that anything a Core Developer may say, no matter in the capacity of a Core Developer or a community member, will have potential impact on the market. It’s hard, if not impossible, to cure the damage that could caused. 
 
## Conclusion

Again, change is always hard, as every great achievement in the river of human history. We hope the community can understand our needs for change.  We hope our supporters and investors can keep their trust in us. We hope that changes like this will make us stronger and move around all the obstacles that lies on our way forward.  Bitshares will be unstoppable because we can always do better than what we’re doing right now.
